## 📍 The Process

This portfolio was born from my desire to have a central place to present my skills, document my journey, and apply for frontend roles. I wanted a clean and modern UI that reflects my personality while being easy to maintain and extend.

I chose **Next.js** for its performance and SEO benefits, **Tailwind CSS** for speed in styling, and **Framer Motion** to add elegant transitions. Every section is thoughtfully designed to highlight not just what I’ve done, but who I am as a developer.

This website is not just a showcase—it's a representation of my growth, passion, and future potential.
